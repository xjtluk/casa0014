# DIY Environmental Monitoring System - Light Control with Vibration and Sound Sensors

## Project Overview
This project involves controlling an RGB light setup using an Arduino-based microcontroller. The system is designed to react to two types of inputs: vibration and sound. When a vibration is detected, the light color changes. Meanwhile, sound levels control the number of active pixels in the light setup, simulating a brightness control based on ambient sound. The system also integrates MQTT for remote control via the internet.

## Requirements
- **Hardware**:
  - Arduino MKR WiFi 1010
  - Vibration Sensor (Analog)
  - Sound Sensor (Analog)
  - RGB Light setup (12 pixels)
  - Wi-Fi access and MQTT broker for remote communication

- **Libraries**:
  - `WiFiNINA.h` - For Wi-Fi connectivity
  - `PubSubClient.h` - For MQTT communication

## Setup
1. **Wi-Fi Configuration**: Connect the Arduino to your Wi-Fi using the SSID and password.
2. **MQTT Broker**: The system connects to an MQTT broker (`mqtt.cetools.org`) for communication. The topic `student/CASA0014/light/29/pixel/` is used for controlling the RGB pixels.

## Functionality
- **Vibration Detection**:
  - When vibration exceeds a set threshold, the light color changes.
  - The color cycles through red, green, blue, and white.
  
- **Sound Detection**:
  - The number of active pixels adjusts based on the sound level.
  - Lower sound levels (0-340) activate 4 pixels, mid levels (341-681) activate 8, and high levels (682-1023) activate all 12 pixels.

- **MQTT Communication**:
  - The Arduino sends MQTT messages to update the light color and brightness (pixel count) based on the inputs.

## Code Explanation
- The code uses **WiFi** to connect to the internet and **MQTT** to communicate with the light setup.
- **Vibration Sensor**: Detects vibrations and changes the light color.
- **Sound Sensor**: Controls the number of active pixels based on the sound level.
- The **`sendmqtt`** function sends RGB color values to each pixel of the light setup.

## Key Functions
- `sendmqtt(int pixelID, int r, int g, int b)`: Sends the color data to the MQTT broker for updating the light pixels.
- `startWifi()`: Connects the Arduino to the Wi-Fi network.
- `reconnectMQTT()`: Ensures the system reconnects to the MQTT broker if disconnected.

## Usage
1. Upload the code to the Arduino.
2. Ensure the vibration and sound sensors are connected to the correct pins (`A0` for vibration, `A1` for sound).
3. Monitor the light setupâ€™s reaction to vibration and sound.

## Troubleshooting
- If the Wi-Fi connection fails, ensure the SSID and password are correctly set.
- For MQTT issues, verify that the broker address and credentials are correct.

Enjoy experimenting with this interactive light control system!
